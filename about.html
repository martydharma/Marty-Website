    <h2>My Passion for Finance and Technology</h2>
    <p>
      My interest in finance began when I started learning about how markets react to economic data and investor behavior. 
      Over time, I became drawn to how algorithms and data analytics can predict trends, mitigate risk, 
      and uncover new investment opportunities. 
      I aspire to build a career where I can use technology to create smarter, data-driven financial tools 
      that make information more accessible to everyone.
